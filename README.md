# Carbonate _(Experimental)_
Create [carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh) previews for all of your code files using the [Carbonara API](https://github.com/petersolopov/carbonara).

Only uses Python's native modules. No additional installation required.

# Instructions:
###### Currently, Carbonate is experiencing some heavy bugs with the creation of Carbon Copies.
###### However, if you would still like to try it out, follow these steps:
1. _download_ carbonate-main
2. _run_ `Terminal`
3. _type_ '`python `' into the `Terminal` (don't forget the space!)
4. _drag and drop_ `main.py` (it is located inside the 'code' folder) into the `Terminal`
5. _drag and drop_ the **folder** you want to **create** carbon copies from into the `Terminal`
6. _drag and drop_ the **folder** you want to **save** the carbon copies to into the `Terminal`

That's it! Just sit back and relax as Carbonate automatically generates your Carbon Copies.
