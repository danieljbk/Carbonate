# Carbonate ![build](https://github.com/petersolopov/carbonara/workflows/build/badge.svg)
###### Currently, Carbonate is experiencing heavy bugs during the creation of Carbon Copies.
Create [carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh) previews for all of your code files using the [Carbonara API](https://github.com/petersolopov/carbonara).

Only uses Python's native modules. No additional installation required.



# Instructions:

1. _Download_ carbonate-main
2. _Run_ `Terminal`
3. _Type_ '`python `' into the `Terminal` (don't forget the space!)
4. _Drag and drop_ `main.py` (located inside the '`code`' folder) into the `Terminal`
5. _Drag and drop_ the **folder** you want to **create** carbon copies from into the `Terminal`
6. _Drag and drop_ the **folder** you want to **save** the carbon copies to into the `Terminal`

That's it! Just sit back and relax as Carbonate automatically generates your Carbon Copies.
